## Customer_Lifetime_Value_Prediction
### Project Description
Customer Lifetime Value means a customer's purchase history from the beginning of its first purchase to the current date.

This means the monetary value of a customer during its relation with the company.

If we know the benefit that a customer brings to the company than it is easier to manage the relations.

We will make CLTV Predicition by using BGNBD and Gamma-Gamma model

Instead of calculate the current value of a custumer lifetime; we will predict the value for example 6 months or 1 year
